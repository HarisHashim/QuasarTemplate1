# Quasar Template 1

> Part of my effort to provide getting started template to future Quasar developers in [FB group Malaysia Developers] (www.facebook.com/groups/Devs.MY/).
>
> Refer this guide to [get started with Quasar](http://github.com/HarisHashim/Mentor-Coaching/blob/master/JS/Quasar/Quickly%20Quasar.pdf). This PDF guide is not related to the code and outdated.
>
> However, assuming that Node jS, Quasar and Vue is already installed "npm install" and then "quasar dev" will do the trick ;)
